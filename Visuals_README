What we have so far:

A way to plot points in c++ files using gnuplot - see testgnu.cpp

remember that all cpp files using the boost options

The plots will save to postscript files (names are set manully so we can adjust to the appropriate name of the data set and iteration count)

The way to create multiple frames in a single eps script is to save it by the same name but with a different title

Note: postscript data can be seen with preview on macs and ghostscript on pcs


What needs to be figured out

How to plot not just from a file, but also from a vector of points (we can't afford to print out a file for each iteration)

For each file, what are the max and min values for both axes (x and y)?

Maybe create a animation of ps files using ghostscript
