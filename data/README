Before running plot.py or generate.py, make sure you have matplot lib, and sklearn installed: 
pip3 install sklearn 
and etc

To generate new cluster data, run generate.py
To plot genrated cluster dat, run plot.py

Both will prompt you for sample size (number of data points) and cluster number
Generate will save a txt file of the name scheme: samplesize_cluster.txt
