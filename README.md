# K-Means Clustering for Astronomical Objects
Shana Li, Jane Hsieh, Aidan Kidder-Wolff

## Summary:
A program that runs the k-means clustering algorithm on a collection of points in space (currently for x-y coordinates) and puts them in k clusters, each with a specified center. The program runs the reclusters and changes centroids until the centers have been stabilized or until the maximum number of iterations has been reached.

The k-means algorithm is as follows:
```
Inputs: integer k indicating the number of desired centers and a set of points to be clustered
Procedure: 
The algorithm begins by randomly assigning k points from the input as initial centeroids
While iteration count and convergence have not been reached: 
    Each point is assigned to its closest centroid
    For each cluster
        Average coordinate all points in cluster is calculated and assigned to be the new centroid of this cluster
    If coordinates of centroids have not changed or if the iteration limit has been reached, the loop terminates
    Otherwise continue reclustering 

```

While k-means clustering can be used for a multitude of purposes, our intention for this project is to determine clusters of stars and galaxies given their coordinates in the sky. Star and galaxy clustering are natural phenomena that has been investigated using numerous scientific tools and methods, but without astronomical instrumentation, means to measure any other physical quality of spacial objects, or years of knowledge in astronomy, k-means clustering is a computationally cheap, statistical way of obtaining this information to some degree of accuracy.

## How to use this program:
The program's main() method generates a KMeans object, which automatically runs the algorithm given k (the number of clusters), and the iteration limit (maximum number of times to re-determine clusters). To change these variables, edit the first two lines of the method that initialize the variables.

## Next steps:
* Support for RA and Dec coordinates. They have to do with angles, but in plotting we will just approximate them to be on a flat plane, and the calculations (distances etc.) work the same way. The main thing of concern is that the format for these are different:

For RA:
```
04h 05m 38s
```
The minute value is 1/60 of the hour, and the second value is 1/60 of the minute. I'm thinking doing this to represent them as digits so the calculations work:
```
4 + 5*1/60 + 38*1/3600 hours
```
I think this would be the best way, unless there's a better one?

The Dec is similar, but in degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds. I think we can do the same thing; the two don't necessarily have to be in the same units, right?
```
48ยบ 50' 2" becomes 48+50*1/60 + 2*1/3600 degrees 
```
60 arcmins in a degree, and 3600 arcsecs in a degree

* Parse data files and load points. There are some good stars/galaxies catalogues online, for some of them you can filter out by the type of object, and then find some way to download them. In the Map/Kmeans class, make a method or something to load in the info and make Points.

* Plotting. Separate plot for each iteration (to look at the progress), with each cluster having their own color. Some library to do this?

* Post-k-means processing to determine the most concentrated areas and sort out the objects that belong in a cluster and the ones that don't. Maybe we'll get there?
