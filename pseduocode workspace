//k-means as Aidan understands it

Create an iterable datastructure with comparable data points. (ex. a bunch (x,y) points into a linked list)
Prompt the user for an integer n, the number of groups desired.

Create n nodes with arbitrary values, and a 'group' field ( random (x,y), [] ). 
While not done
  For each data point, add the datapoint to the closest node's group
  For each node, calculate the average values of all the points in it's group. (ex. average x and y values)
  If the average value equals the node position for all nodes
    Done is true
  Else
    Move the nodes to the new averaged position
    Empty each nodes' group
Return the current node grouping.
